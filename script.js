// QUESTION 1:
//You are presented with a string with a collection of data which are mixed alphabets i.e., "abdsgyhidsaadgbdaasbvcydsaabdgsaayre", create a function that will count through the string and show the number of a, b, d and y each contained in the string.
// Note: the output is expected to be a number for each of the counted elements.


//1. Declare String of numbers
let stringLetters = "abdsgyhidsaadgbdaasbvcydsaabdgsaayre";
// Initialize counts for 'a', 'b', 'd', and 'y' to 0
let string_a = 0;
let string_b = 0;
let string_d = 0;
let string_y = 0;
let count;
